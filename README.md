# Tailor-connect

1.  **Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    *(This creates a hidden `.git` directory to track changes.)*

2.  **Add your project files to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    # Or to add a specific file:
    # git add your-file.txt
    ```
    *(The staging area prepares changes to be included in the next commit.)*

3.  **Commit your staged changes (create a snapshot of your project's state):**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of project files"
    # The message in quotes should be a concise description of the changes.
    ```
